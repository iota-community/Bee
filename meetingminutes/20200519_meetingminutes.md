:busts_in_silhouette: Q&A Round
---

**Q**: How much time is necessary to participate in?
  
**A**: This completely depends on your availability. Already by engaging 1h/week you can contribute on different goals.

**Q**: How much experience is recommended/required?
  
**A**: Experience is very subjective.. I'd say that to have fresh eyes on our software also helps us see things that we give for granted and might be even more helpful to make it a better experience for people approaching IOTA for the first time, while if you want to provide a proof-of-concept, more experience in IOTA will help you develop it faster..

**Q**:What does "Create a list of RFPâ€™s for the EDF to fund Open Source development" mean? Is it like a soft-due-diligence to pre-filter the proposals before they get to the IF EDF team?
  
**A**: Example: the Experience team is working on Streams, and then we realize "wouldn't it be nice to have a simple to use npm package for this?"
Then this input would be provided to the EDF team (Mark primarily) and we can make a Request for Proposal for that particular task
So the Experience team essentially finds gaps in what is being offered right now by our products, and how to further extend / improve them
